# Tranfer-learning-using-VGG16
Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning where knowledge gained from one task is reused to improve performance on a related task <BR>
<BR>
How it works:<BR>
<BR>
Pre-trained Model: Start with a model that has already been trained for a specific task using a large dataset. This pre-trained model has learned general features and patterns relevant to various related tasks.<BR>

Base Model: The pre-trained model is called the base model. It consists of layers that have learned hierarchical feature representations from the incoming data.<BR>

Transfer to a New Task: When you encounter a new task (the target task), you can use the base model as a starting point. Instead of training a new model from scratch, you fine-tune the base model on the new task. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the model’s weights using a smaller dataset specific to the target task.<BR>
<BR>
Benefits of Transfer Learning:<BR>
Faster Learning: By using the learned features from the base model, the new model can learn more quickly and effectively on the target task.<BR>
Generalization: The base model has already learned general features that are likely to be useful in the new task, preventing overfitting.<BR>
Limited Data: Transfer learning is especially useful when you have limited data for the target task.<BR>

VGG-16 (short for Visual Geometry Group 16) is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that gained prominence due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and strong performance on various computer vision tasks. <BR>
<BR>
Architecture:<BR>
VGG-16 was proposed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford in 2014.
It consists of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.
The model’s architecture features a stack of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, with progressively increasing depth.
Despite its simplicity compared to more recent architectures, VGG-16 remains a popular choice due to its versatility and excellent performance.<BR>
<BR>
ImageNet Challenge:<BR>
The ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) is an annual competition in computer vision.
VGG16 achieved top ranks in both tasks:
Object Localization: Detecting objects from 200 classes.
Image Classification: Classifying images into 1000 categories.
It achieved an impressive 92.7% top-5 test accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, which contains 14 million images across 1000 classes.<BR>
<BR>
Input and Output:<BR>
VGG-16 processes input images of fixed size (224x224) with RGB channels.
The model outputs a vector of 1000 values, representing the classification probabilities for corresponding classes.
The softmax function ensures that these probabilities sum up to 1.
